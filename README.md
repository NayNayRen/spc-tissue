This is another school project for a fake issue logging system.
Users can register with basic info.
Once registered you can log in and create any issue(or anything for that matter).
User can then remove logged issues from the display if they desire.
User password is saved to local storage for app uses only.
If you log in with the username 'admin@tissue.com' and password of 'admin123' you will be redirected
to a graph page that animates on click.
Thank you for stopping by. :-)
